/// üéÑ Day 4: What do you call a serialized reindeer? Serdeer!

/// Under the soft glow of the Northern Lights, Santa's reindeer are training for the big night. But, oh deer! The reindeer's stats have been serialized into an unknown format after a playful elf accidentally spilled hot cocoa on the central computer. The data needs to be deserialized so the reindeer team can be assembled based on their combined strength.
/// ‚≠ê Task 1: Reindeer cheer

/// The task is to create a POST endpoint /4/strength that calculates the combined strength of a group of reindeer, so that Santa knows if they can pull his sled through the skies.

/// The input to the endpoint is a JSON array containing information about each reindeer. Each reindeer is represented as an object with two attributes: "name" (string) and "strength" (integer). Collect the strength of each reindeer and respond with the sum.
